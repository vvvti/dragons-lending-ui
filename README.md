## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Draco Social Lending is a project introducing the idea of ​​"social lending" to the Polish market. Simply put, our service allows for granting loans between individuals without the inter mediation of banks - offering customers speed, simplicity and convenience. We believe that such projects are the future of banking. From the very beginning, banks have linked people who have money (through deposits and other investment products of this type) with those who need it (by providing loans). It is only in recent years, with the development of the Internet and mobile phones, that this status quo may change for the first time. In order to connect people who need money with those who have it, you no longer need a bank - it is enough to use modern technologies, i.e. websites and applications for mobile phones. This is an analogous situation to the changes that have taken place in trade - bazaars and shops have partially replaced auction sites and online stores. The lack of "physicality" in both commerce and banking simply has many undeniable advantages. How do we want to function? What are our goals? Well, we believe that we have a unique opportunity to improve and simplify the transfer of money between people.
